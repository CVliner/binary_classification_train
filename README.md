### Handling Complex Images - Happy or Sad Dataset


In this project you will be using the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad.

Create a convolutional neural network that trains to 99.9% accuracy on these images,  which cancels training upon hitting this training accuracy threshold.

Begin by taking a look at some images of the dataset.

Notice that all the images are contained within the `./data/` directory.

This directory contains two subdirectories `happy/` and `sad/` and each image is saved under the subdirectory related to the class it belongs to.

The images should have a resolution of 150x150. This is very important because this will be the input size of the first layer in your network.

The last dimension refers to each one of the 3 RGB channels that are used to represent colored images.

Keras provides great support for preprocessing image data. A lot can be accomplished by using the `ImageDataGenerator` class. Be sure to check out the [docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator) if you get stuck in the next exercise. In particular you might want to pay attention to the `rescale` argument when instantiating the `ImageDataGenerator` and to the [`flow_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator#flow_from_directory) method.

**Expected Output:**
```
Found 80 images belonging to 2 classes.
```

### Creating and training your model

Finally, complete the `train_happy_sad_model` function below. This function should return your  neural network.
